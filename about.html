  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
  This is a cycloidal gear generator inspired by <a href="https://github.com/roTechnic">roTechnic</a> and his amazing videos on the topic. 
  </p>
  <p>I was following along with his video <a href="https://youtu.be/y9vLVXjz2c0?si=-Z8qEBH1GKhWnzbq">Designing a cycloidal drive in Python and Fusion 360</a> and basically don't like dealing with python environments, and don't use fusion 360. That said, I do want to learn to use cycloidal drives better and this seemed like it would help. It should be easy enough to take the svg and convert it into some kind of file the CAD software of your choosing can use.
  </p>
  <p>I basically followed along with his video and <a href="https://github.com/roTechnic/CycloidalDesign">code</a>. Things were going well until I got to the offset. His offset is a little fancier than I could seem to figure out on my own, so with the help of LLMs was able to approximate calculus to achieve the offset. If there are any bugs, I blame AI, but please submit an issue or PR.
